## Algorithm Illuminated Active Reading

Ths is an active reading project of the book series **Algorithm Illuminated** by [Tim Roughgarden](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/).

- The website of the book series [here](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/algorithmsilluminated.html)

### What's mean active reading?

Read with the determination to understand clearly the books and distill all the material through the implementation of the algorithms treated in the book, highlight key concepts, solve the exercises during and at the end of the chapters, and incorporate additionnal material to complement some knowledge requierements.

Python on jupyter notebook will be used to the project.
